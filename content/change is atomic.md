A pattern I've noticed in my #life:
- I notice that I'm doing something unaligned with [[goodness(universe)|my values]].
- I experience a large amount of cognitive dissonance.
- I also experience decision paralysis due to thinking about sunk costs and any obstacles to changing my actions.
- One day, I finally decide to actually change my actions.
- Sometimes the change fails to take after a day / week. 
- Sometimes the change sticks and is permanent.

I think it doesn't have to be this way!
The alternative is [[acting NOW]].
To be precise, I'm suggesting that I increase my reaction speed to cognitive dissonance.

A word of *caution* -- [[cognitive distortion list|cognitive distortions]] can feel similar to cognitive dissonance.
So, a more precise formulation of my strategy is, 
- When I notice some kind of persistent thought of "I'm doing something wrong"
- Evaluate whether this thought is accurate.
	- If the thought is true, act now.
	- If false, mark it as such and evict it from mind.
