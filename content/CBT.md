The thesis of cognitive behavior therapy is something like 
> "depression is caused by distorted thought patterns"

Some categories of distorted thought patterns are:

- All or nothing thinking
	"I got a question wrong on the test so I'm a failure"
- discounting the positive /  mental filter
- should statements
- jumping to conclusions / [[mind reading]]
- labeling
	seeing failings as character deficits rather than bad actions
- overgeneralization
- emotional reasoning 
  (assuming that your emotions are accurate)
  (e.g., "I feel bad, so I must be bad.")
