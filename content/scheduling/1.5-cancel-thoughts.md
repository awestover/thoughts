UPDATE: maybe going to just solve this in [[1.5-cancel]]

In [[phi-cancel-width-zero]] we show how to be $\phi$-competitive in the width-zero cancel model. 
But I'm somewhat inclined to believe that our algorithm can be improved, that the lower bound of $1.5$ from [[cancel-lower-bound]] is the right answer.

Here are some preliminary thoughts on how we might go about beating it. 

- Maybe you should define $\widetilde{C}_{\opt_i}$. Either as an analysis tool or actually something that our algorithm thinks about.
- As discussed in the other document it's the last step of lemma 3 that feels wasetful. 
	- Specifically seems worth thinking about the following case:
	- $t_i = t_{i+1}$, 
	- $\opt$ suffix is $\ser, \par, \par$
	- $\phic$ suffix is $\par, \par, \par$
