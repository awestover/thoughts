>[!info] Remark
>A general lemma is that you can just think about completion time of TAPs with no OPT-gaps and we can boost this to an awake time result. The reason is if you're competitive on each individual TAP then smashing them together can only be good for you. I'm not saying you can use the same strategy that you otherwise would, you should probably pause the first TAP and finish it later. But hopefully this is clear.
