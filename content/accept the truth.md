One of the core principles of DBT is "acceptance".
I think the nomenclature can be quite misleading.

But what the term is supposed to mean is "you should not deny reality"

Litany of Tarski (paraphrased bc I have no internet connection atm)

"What's true is already so. 
Admitting that won't make it any worse. 
If X is true, then I want to believe X. 
If X is true then I can "stand" fact X; I already am. 
If X is false, then I want to believe not X.
"
