It's important to be specific. Especially in a blog with a lot of abstract content. 

Examples / analogies can be hard to come up with, but they communicate a lot.

The "be specific" advice also strongly applies to working on technical problems.
I always would like to hear the simplest possible example of something before hearing too much more about it.
