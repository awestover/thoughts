The other day I was brushing up on some physics (it has been a *long* time since I did physics and I need to take a physics test at some point so that MIT will let me graduate). 

I've been studying mechanics and I noticed something interesting.

> "There's no such thing as centripetal force"

Centripetal force is just the label that we give to a net force that results in an object following a circular motion pattern. 
That is, if you show me a ball swinging on a rope in a circular trajectory, then it is quite true that there is a net force acting on the ball, accelerating it towards the center of the circle. 

But this is *explanative*. Not *predictive*.

If you give me a setup, you say "Here's a rocket, it has velocity $v_0$ straight away from the center of earth and is distance $d_0$ from the center of earth, will this rocket end up orbiting the earth, and if so at what radius?" 
I can't *predict* the answer based on "centripetal force". I need to know about gravitational attraction. 

But this reminded me of something important:
- It's super easy to explain things with hindsight. 
- But much harder to predict them in advance. 

So, be wary of after-the-fact explanations.
