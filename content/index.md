title: Thoughts
---
Welcome to my blog / personal wiki. See also [my website](https://awestover.github.io).
Note: at least atm this blog is *primarily not math related*. \
If you want some math, come talk to me. 

[0stack/](0stack/):
This is the blog-like part of skyspace3.0. Specifically, it is a collection of serialized posts. 

[[scheduling]]: 
Some notes on a cool math problem.

[[the-objective]]:
Some *extremely not finished* thoughts about life.\
This collection of posts explores some difficult and uncomfortable questions such as 
1. What do I want / value?
2. What should I want / value?
3. How should I act?

Alas, [nothing stops](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/nothing-stops). I must live, and I must blog. So here it is. \
If you find these topics interesting let me know: I'd love to discuss them with you!
Also, if there is some content here where
- it is very unfinished and you'd like it to be finished
- you think I have come to a false / harmful conclusion
then I implore you to talk to me about this! This seems like a nice algorithm for improving the quality of this repository of thoughts.
