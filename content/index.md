title: Thoughts
---
Welcome to my personal blog. If you're interested in my research, then you are in the wrong place. Go to [my website](https://awestover.github.io).

[0stack/](https://awestover.github.io/thoughts/0stack/):
This is the blog-like part of skyspace3.0. Specifically, it is a collection of serialized posts. 

[[cooking]]: 
Some of my favorite recipes. 

[[the objective]]:
Some *extremely not finished* thoughts about life.\
This collection of posts explores some difficult and uncomfortable questions such as 
1. What do I want / value?
2. What should I want / value?
3. How should I act?
Alas, [nothing stops](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/nothing-stops). I must live, and I must blog. So here it is. \
If you find these topics interesting let me know: I'd love to discuss them with you!
Also, if there is some content here where
- it is very unfinished and you'd like it to be finished
- you think I have come to a false / harmful conclusion
then I implore you to talk to me about this! This seems like a nice algorithm for improving the quality of this repository of thoughts. 

[[alignment]]
I am pretty worried that highly capable AI is created by 2040. If this happens,
it seems highly likely that it will result in all humans being dead. In this
connected component of posts I discuss why I believe these two claims, and
discuss the implications of these claims.
