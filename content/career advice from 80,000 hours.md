Work that's engaging:
1. The **freedom** to decide how to perform your work.
2. **Clear tasks**, with a clearly defined start and end.
3. **Variety** in the types of tasks.
4. **Feedback**, so you know how well you’re doing.

There’s a [growing body of evidence](https://80000hours.org/articles/job-satisfaction-research/#2-work-that-helps-others) that helping others is a key ingredient for life satisfaction. People who volunteer are less depressed and healthier. A meta-analysis of 23 randomised studies showed that performing acts of kindness makes the _giver_ happier.[14](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/#fn-14) And a global survey found that people who donate to charity are as satisfied with their lives as those who earn twice as much.[15](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/#fn-15)

### 1. engaging
### 2. helps others
### 3. work you’re good at
  
Being good at your work gives you a sense of achievement, a key ingredient of life satisfaction discovered by positive psychology.

It also gives you the power to negotiate for the other components of a fulfilling job — such as the ability to work on meaningful projects, undertake engaging tasks, and earn fair pay. If people value your contribution, you can ask for these conditions in return.

For both reasons, skill ultimately trumps interest. Even if you love art, if you pursue it as a career but aren’t good at it, you’ll end up doing boring graphic design for companies you don’t care about.

That’s not to say you should only do work you’re already good at — but you do want the _potential_ to get good at it.

(We have a whole [article later in the guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/) about working out what you’re good at, and another on [how to invest in your skills](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/).)

### 5. Work that doesn’t have major negatives

You don’t _have_ to get all the ingredients of a fulfilling life from your job. It’s possible to find a job that pays the bills and excel in a side project; or to find a sense of meaning through philanthropy or volunteering; or to build great relationships outside of work.

1. Engaging work that lets you enter a state of flow (freedom, variety, clear tasks, feedback).
2. Work that helps others.
3. Work you’re good at.
4. Supportive colleagues.
5. No major negatives, like long hours or unfair pay.
6. A job that fits your personal life.

## Apply this to your own career

These six ingredients, especially helping others and getting good at your job, can act as guiding lights — they’re what to aim for to find in a dream job long term.

Here are some exercises to help you start applying them.

1. Practice using the six ingredients to make some comparisons. Pick two options you’re interested in, then score them from 1 to 5 on each factor.
2. The six ingredients we list are only a starting point. There may be other factors that are especially important to you, so we also recommend doing the following exercises. They’re not perfect — as we saw earlier, our memories of what we’ve found fulfilling can be unreliable — but completely ignoring your past experience isn’t wise either.[17](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/#fn-17) These questions should give you hints about what you find most fulfilling:
    - When have you been most fulfilled in the past? What did these times have in common?
    - Imagine you just found out you’re going to die in 10 years. What would you spend your time doing?
    - Can you make any of our six factors more specific? For example, what _kinds_ of people do you most like to work with?
3. Now, combine our list with your own thoughts to determine the four to eight factors that are most important to you in a dream job.
4. When you’re comparing your options in the future, you can use this list of factors to work out which is best. Don’t expect to find an option that’s best on every dimension; rather, focus on finding the option that’s best on balance.
