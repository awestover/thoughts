Peter Singer and some EA's argue that ultimately all people should receive equal weight in your utility function. 

I think tldr is, yes, the welfare of all people figures into [[goodness(universe)]].

Some questions that this poses:

- [[Is morality absolute?]]
- Currently, what weights do people have in my [[goodness(universe)|objective function]]?
- [[Can I change my objective function? Should I?]]

An interesting point (made by EY): 
It is rational to take [[akrasia]] into account. 
Suppose the thought "I should give 90% of my money to charity" caused you severe anxiety and prevented you from giving even 5% of your money to charity. Then the thought was not actually useful. There is no point in railing "I shouldn't be this weak". Instead, [[accept the truth]], abandon the incapacitating thought, donate 5% right now, and be open to updating your actions in the future.
