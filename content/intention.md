> Q: What does it mean to live with **intention**?\
> A: Here are some components of what this means:

1. Have a clearly defined [[goodness(universe)|objective function]].
2. It's very useful to have [[good subgoals]], and a way of tracking progress
3. Understand [[akrasia]]: don't put yourself in situations that facilitate [[self-betrayal]].
4. Understand the importance of controlling your environment and the [[stimuli]] that you expose yourself to. 

If you want to know "is pursuing action X in line with living intentionally", basically just compare it against the above list.
