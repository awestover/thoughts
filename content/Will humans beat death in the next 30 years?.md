tldr:

- A $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of people think it's very unlikely.
- Some people think that AI might solve death. 
	- But I'm somewhat inclined to think that $\Pr[\text{extinction}\mid \text{AI gets this good}]$ is also pretty high.  So, it's not really clear how viable of an approach this is. 
- In the meantime, it's probably good to exercise and [[food-water|eat healthily]].
