> Q: How, if at all does [[the objective]] change if you estimate Pr that humans (in particular me) are extinct before 2030 is larger than 10 percent?

- Well, this would mean that a lot of long term goals do not matter at all. 
- For instance, "curing aging" would no longer be such an important thing to do. 
- It seems to make "accumulate money" a pretty obviously bad strategy. This can help cure an aversion to allocating money to wherever you think it should go in order to maximize utility. 
- One other update is that you should try to do some things to lower x-risk.  Should you drop everything and just work on reducing x-risk? I mean, maybe. I'm not sure.
- I think it makes it more obvious that you shouldn't engage in trade-offs of "pain now" for nebulous future benefits. 

However, the reality is, even if you didn't think this, you'd be a fool to assign Pr(yourself dying in the next 50 years) < 10\%.
Heck, Pr(extinction) per year has probably been pretty high since the end of WW2.
