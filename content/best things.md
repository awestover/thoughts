> Q: What are the best things I've done?
# "Best" by [taste](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/aesthetics-and-taste):

**scheduling, allocation, hashing, P3's vs C6's, pigeons**
-  Beautiful aspects of these projects:
	1. I choose to care about them. Nobody made me. 
	2. There were many epic battle plans, and epic battles.
	3. Ground won and ground lost. 
	4. Creating really cool **ideas** and pictures. 
	5. I love having incremental progress
	7. I like how you can "actually try". Like, my best example of this is, on the day when I dedicated myself fully to solving that pigeon problem, it felt really good and I actually discovered something. Maybe not every day can be like that, but I think I have some power to create days like that. 
	8. I like working closely with others on these projects. 
- Unsatisfactory aspects of these projects: 
	1. Failure to internalize [[your work is not your worth]]
	2. Sometimes worked on these too much, felt somewhat burnt out. 
	3. Sometimes these problems felt a little bit "cute", and I worry that they aren't important. But sometimes they feel fundamental and worth thinking about. There's a mix here. 

**Enchanted forest / projects with Kevin**
- I liked working with someone on a large project that we made up because we thought it was cool. 
- I enjoyed the technical challenge of it. 
- I liked that it was creative and beautiful. 

**hackathons**
- I like coming up with a plan, breaking down a complex problem, and the rapid prototyping. 

**Outings**
- Walking to the beach! and other places.
- Pizza w/ friends
- Cooking
- Contact (the game)

**Talking to people about what I'm working on, especially when they can [[listening|listen]] well** 

**Working on cool math problems with people**

**Corona coding club**
- Enjoyed teaching peers and proactively responding to environment.

**BHS Yearbook project**
- big project with collaboration, and it actually had an impact on ppl. 
- It had a big impact on me alone! I still read these notes. It wouldn't have happened without this app. 

**Talking to random people**

Addendum it should be noted that advice from [[career advice from 80,000 hours]] is probably still worth considering. 
In particular, I haven't ever really *tried* doing anything other than TCS research. 
So of course I can't based on historical data conclude that doing radically breaking status quo things like
- healthcare engineer / research
- pandemic prevention research / misc other "applying computery stuff to sciencey problems"
- ML research / safety research
wouldn't be better. 

This is not hedging; it's an admission that [[wrong exists]].
It's not [[procrastinating choices]], as I plan on rectifying this deficit of experience.
