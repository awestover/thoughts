Note: I'll phrase the #life advice here as advice to myself, but I suspect that it's pretty good advice for you as well.

**Claim**: 
I should seek to fill my life with more quality-adjusted-seconds-spent-socializing.

**Proof**:
- This is literally part of [[the objective]] -- one of my terminal values.
- It can lead to new opportunities.
- It tends to increase my happiness.
- It is helpful in clarifying ideas.

> Q: Why is this post called "taking social initiative"?

Because my default mode of being is not well calibrated to how important I think this is: I still feel some level of resistance to initiating social interactions.
(Although I've definitely seen personal progress here, and it feels like a tractable problem).

**What [[CBT|cognitive distortions]] cause this?**
- Worry that I'm inconveniencing people.
- "Fear of being rejected".
	- This implicitly is rooted in a need for external validation / an aversion to invalidation.
- Sometimes a worry of "I don't haven't been particularly productive today and don't want to have to admit this to someone".

**Bad methods for dealing with this**:
- Thinking that other people are responsible for initiating social interactions with me.
- Avoiding social interactions.
- Worrying about whether I'm inconveniencing someone, and then having to overcome this to initiate social interaction.
	- I think it'd be way better -- for all parties -- if I was not worried about this, and default expected people to say yes. While of course also not being perturbed if they say no.
- Another bad method I sometimes employ is trying to prevent "pain of rejection" by pre-committing to not being too sad if someone says no to a social invitation. More specifically, this is bad if my method for doing this is devaluing the interaction -- like saying "I won't be too disappointed if this interaction with person X doesn't pan out, because I wasn't even that excited to see them".

**Better methods for dealing with this** 
- Remembering that I [[the world is full of allies]]
- Not [[worrying about giving offense]]
- **Be charitable to people in your thoughts.**
- Schedule recurring social events
	- An easy way to defeat [[akrasia]] / free up [[human compute is scarce|compute]] :)
