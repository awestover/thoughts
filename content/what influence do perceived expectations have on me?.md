- Paul Graham has an essay about the danger of prestige which I thought was interesting.

There are perceived expectations from society generally, 
and also from people you know personally. 

I have distinguished between perceived expectations and expectations for two reasons:
-  To point out that perceived expectations might be a result of [[mind reading]] rather than a reflection of reality.
- To point out that perceiving expectations is a choice on part of the agent. 

tldr
- My baseline is to conform to societal expectations.
- There is actually some non-zero amount of logic behind this: 
	"If you're walking in a crowd, and everyone starts running the opposite direction to the direction that you're walking, then maybe it's because there is some danger ahead, or the train is down and you need to take the shuttle bus."
- But, my baseline takes expectations, weights perceived expectations too heavily.
