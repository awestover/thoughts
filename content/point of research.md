> Q: What is the point of doing research?\
> A: Research has 3 primary goals.

1. Create ideas that lead to a better universe.
2. Expand the set of fundamental truths that humanity understands. 
3. Personally create some cool ideas, learn cool stuff, make a nice piece of art, and have a fun time doing it.

Some comments:
(2) Is intrinsically worthwhile, not just a means to steering the universe; but of course it does sometimes help steer the universe too.
Research which you don't personally find engaging -- i.e., research lacking (3) -- is unlikely to sustainably contribute to (1) or (2), at least for me. But it's also worth noting that research satisfying (1) and (2) likely facilitate (3): if you're working on important and interesting stuff then people will want to work with you and it'll encourage you to share your work etc.
