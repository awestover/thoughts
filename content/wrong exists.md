It's easy to say "X is uncertain".
But this doesn't preclude the statement "X is more likely than Y". 

So, "X is uncertain" is a stupid reason for betting on X versus Y; at least in the absence of commensurately good payoff odds. In which case it maybe gets more complicated. [[win-the-lottery-utility]]
