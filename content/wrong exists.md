It's easy to say "X is uncertain". But this doesn't preclude the statement "X is more likely than Y". 

So, "X is uncertain" is a stupid reason for betting on X versus Y; at least in the absence of commensurately good payoff odds. 
(In which case it maybe gets more complicated, see [[win-the-lottery-utility]])

Similarly, it's easy to say "actions X and Y both have pros and cons". But this doesn't mean that you should have no preference over choosing action X to action Y.

Eliezer Yudkowsky uses the phrase "the [Fallacy of Gray](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/gFvira6tHpLXnqCLH/p/dLJv2CoRCgeC2mPgj) " to refer to arguments like this:
- "You can't be sure of ..."
- "No one's perfect."

Fallacy of Gray reasoning can lead to complacently [[maintaining the status quo]] and [[not fail with abandon|failing with abandon]].

For instance, 
- Suppose you were on a diet. And then you broke it. Then you might say "well, I guess I broke my diet there is no more point in eating healthily any more". (still bad)
- I don't *know* that this other career would be better than my current career, so it doesn't matter if I switch.
