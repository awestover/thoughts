As a human my L1-cache is tiny. So here is the compressed list:

You might notice that if you made this into an acronym it would spell `misss`.
You might think that if we are making an analogy to cache, then a better acronym would have been `hit`. Fortunately this is incorrect. This has something to do with cats, and I cannot elaborate for legal reasons. But anyways, how to prevent something from getting evicted from cache?
Well, let's assume that your cache is managed by LRU. 
Then just say `cache miss` out loud every 30 minutes. Yup pretty simple. 

# health

**sleep**: 10-6. consistently. 

**exercise**: when you wake up, and in the afternoon. As breaks from work. 

**technology**: check communications once per day (namely, at 9pm). state purpose verbally; no aimlessness

**social**: talk to people 

**food**: don't eat too much. wait till hungry to eat. avoid unhealthy food. 

**water**: drink lots

# mental health

have a schedule of fun things to do

go places

**Avoid "minor" concessions**
- they're never *actually* minor (historically)
- except, also, don't *fail with abandon*, concessions can be minor!

"recovery strategies":
- good: human interaction, going outside 
- bad: anything involving media

# rationality

- stare into the abyss soon, but not when in poor condition.
- pain is not the unit of effort
- sunk costs, inconvenience, halo, motivated reasoning etc don't necessarily mean you hold incorrect beliefs, but they should cause you to be more skeptical
- Do you want to X or to have X'ed?
