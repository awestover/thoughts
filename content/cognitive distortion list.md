The thesis of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is something like 
> Depression is caused by distorted thought patterns, called **cognitive distortions**.

Some categories of distorted thought patterns are:

- All or nothing thinking
	"I got a question wrong on the test so I'm a failure"
- Discounting the positive /  mental filter
- Should statements
- Jumping to conclusions / [[mind reading]]
- Labeling
	Seeing failings as character deficits rather than bad actions
- Over-generalization
- Emotional reasoning 
  (assuming that your emotions are accurate)
  (e.g., "I feel bad, so I must be bad.")
