I think I first heard the phrase "Self betrayal" in "The Anatomy of peace" (which is an excellent book, fyi).

Self betrayal means doing something that goes against your [[goodness(universe)|values]].
Why do we engage in self betrayal? Probably part of it is we are running [[avoid_discomfort.cpp]].
Some kind of bias towards not breaking the status quo.

Example:
- Have inclination "I should do nice thing"
- Subconcciously, something like [[avoid_discomfort.cpp]] starts running
- If you are weak / unpracticed at noticing this and countering it or whatever:
	- Have secondary analytical thought, i.e., [[justification]]
	- e.g., "Oh, but that would be akward for reason X."
	- or, "I couldn't really do that, because reason X"
	- tldr: [[excuses]]

What are the consequences of self-betrayal?
Extremely bad.
