First, to clarify, I believe in **moral realism**. This means, that [[goodness(universe)]] is not actually up to me to define, it's a quantity that exists even if I cease to exist. Of course, my perception of [[goodness(universe)]], and the heuristics that I use to approximate [[goodness(universe)]], can totally change, and it's great if these change to being more accurate. But that's not what this post is about. This post asks the question of can/should I change [[how I want to spend my life]].

Before answering this question, we can address a simpler question:

> Q: Does my "objective function" change over time?\
> A: [[prediction vs explanation|Empirically,]] Yes. 

The question of *can* I change my objective function is a bit more interesting. First, to even discuss this we have to agree that [[determinism is useless]]. \
So, I can choose things -- nice. 

At this point I think the question of "can I change my objective function" becomes a bit confusing; luckily [[taboo]] resolves the confusion:

I *definitely can* try to expose myself to new data / world perspectives and be [[accept the truth|open]] to updating [[how I want to spend my life]]. For instance, maybe I [[questions to connect|ask]] a friend "what's one of your best habits?" And they respond "I don't eat things with [[food-water|high sugar content]]." Then, if I decide that being healthy is valuable to me, this might cause me to update my "how I live my life" to avoid eating bad foods.

Of course, you could argue that this doesn't really constitute a fundamental change in [[how I want to spend my life]], but rather it represents a change in policies to better reflect [[how I want to spend my life]] based on an increased amount of data.

Anyways, framed like this, the answer to "should I change my objective function"
becomes pretty clear: I should act to try to shape my objective function to be
more good. For instance, I can do this by surrounding myself with good people,
and exposing myself to good ideas. If I so desired, I could make my objective function worse, e.g., by doing things which cause me to forget my values. And that's obviously pretty bad.
