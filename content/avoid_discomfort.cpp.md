I have a "main process" that I interpret as my *self*.
But, it's running on a system with a bunch of other processes.

One big competing subprocess is called `avoid discomfort`
Now it makes sense why this exists. This drives humans to [[food-water|obtain food]], to maintain homeostasis. It's intended to be adaptive. But it can be maladaptive. 

**Key:** this subprocess is distinct from me. I can decide to ignore it's instructions. 
Here are some examples of times when ignoring the `avoid discomfort` messages have been helpful:

- Not eating food for a bit. Can increase concentration and just generally feels good sometimes.
- Ignoring messages wrt social anxiety. E.g., just overriding `avoid discomfort` and running my `what are nice things to say to help someone feel cared about, and to be supportive and nice` software. See [[talking-to-people]]
- Overriding "go back to bed" tired brain message and just getting out of bed and running around. 
- Overriding "this is hard" message wrt math and trying some more anyways. 

Honestly the more you look at it, the `avoid discomfort` software really looks like a virus. 
Can this virus be contagious? Maybe. [[what influence do perceived expectations have on me?|conformity]]
The cure certainly can be contagious: it can be inspirational to see other people override this process. 
In any case, neither of these are strict rules. I think if you develop the right mindset then actually being exposed to examples of other people being ruled by `avoid discomfort` can further repulse you from this habit. But you want to be careful with this [[is judging people a good idea?]]. 

So, at this point it should be clear that it is often [[the objective|desirable]] to override `avoid discomfort` signals.
But, they are nontrivial to override. I don't think there is really a `kill -9` for them.
