**What determines the goodness of the universe?**\
The goodness of the universe is determined by the quantity times quality of conscious experience. \
People with hopes and dreams. \
People who create art, connect with other humans and care about other humans and various projects. \
People who experience and share joy and excitement.\
People who rise to challenges, and become better people.\
This is what makes the universe good.

And I [[how I want to spend my life|desire to make the universe more good]].
