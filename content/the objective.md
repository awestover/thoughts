In this post I explore the current state of Alek's Objective function.
Some related and important questions include: [[Can I change my objective function?]] and [[Should I change my objective function?]]
But it's impossible to measure diffs to my objective function without actually knowing what it's starting out as. 

**Fact 1:** 
Alek is an agent with preferences. Alek prefers some states to other states. 

For the duration of the post we shall use $J_A(\theta)$ to denote Alek's objective function, where $\theta$ is "state".

**Fact 2:**
Alek is an agent that acts. Alek's actions have an impact on $\theta$, which in turn impacts $J_A(\theta).$

**Fact 3:**
There is no such thing as a no-op action. 
Time increments. Entropy rises. No moment ever recurs. There are ([[Will humans beat death in the next 30 years?|presumably]]) no replays.

Fact 1 is probably the most intuitive, but it still has some complexity.
One challenge relating to fact 1 is that I don't have direct access to $J_A(\theta)$.
At best, I can obtain noisy approximations to $J_A(\theta)$. 
Factors contributing to the noise I must fight when trying to determine $J_A(\theta)$ include:
- how much I [[sleep|slept]] last night
- how much [[food-water|food and water]] I've been consuming
- how I have responded to, and perceived, the events of the day
- the set of [[CBT|cognitions]] that I've been letting be prominent in my mind
- the set of [[stimuli]] that I have exposed my brain to 

But in some sense modelling my understanding of $J_A(\theta)$ as being "I get $J_A(\theta)+\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$" is overly optimistic. A more realistic model might be that my brain runs processes like [[avoid_discomfort.cpp]] that are each allowed to shift mess with the output of my query to $J_A(\theta)$ and they may do so adversarially for their own nefarious purposes.

Fact 2: 
I have [[responsibility]].

Related to Fact 3:
[[wrong exists]], and it's totally fair game for "status quo" to be wrong. 
Furthermore, [[procrastinating choices]] is a choice, and often wrong.

# ok, so what is my current objective function?

(1) Help solve interesting and important problems.
- Good problems generally require "epic plans" and collaboration.
- A good litmus test for whether a problem is good is whether I'd
    care about it if someone else had researched it.

(2) Be happy and healthy.
- A large part of this is social habits:
  - sharing what I'm working on
  - listening deeply to others
  - going on hikes
  - making food
  - being nice in small ways
- This also includes other habits:
  - getting good sleep
  - not getting distracted

(3) Promote the happiness and healthiness of other people, now and in the future. 

I have arrived at this list largely by a historical reflection on "what are the [[best things]]"
