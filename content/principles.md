# health

**sleep**: 10-6. consistently. 

**exercise**: when you wake up, and in the afternoon. As breaks from work. 

**technology**: 
check communications once per day (namely, at 9pm)
state purpose verbally; no aimlessness

**social**

**food**: don't eat too much. wait till hungry to eat. avoid unhealthy food. 

**water**: drink lots

# mental health

go places

**Avoid "minor" concessions**
- they're never *actually* minor (historically)
- except, also, don't *fail with abandon*, concessions can be minor!

"recovery strategies":
- good: human interaction, going outside 
- bad: anything involving media
# rationality

stare into the abyss soon, but not when in poor condition.

pain is not the unit of effort

sunk costs, inconvenience, halo, motivated reasoning etc don't necessarily mean you hold incorrect beliefs, but they should cause you to be more skeptical

Do you want to X or to have X'ed?
