# health

**sleep**: 10-6. consistently. 

**exercise**: when you wake up, and in the afternoon. As breaks from work. 

**technology**: 
check communications once per day (namely, at 9pm)
state purpose verbally; no aimlessness

**social**

**food**: don't eat too much. wait till hungry to eat. avoid unhealthy food. 

**water**: drink lots

# mental health

go places

**Avoid "minor" concessions**
- they're never *actually* minor

"recovery strategies":
- good: human interaction, going outside 
- bad: anything involving media
# rationality

stare into the abyss soon, but not when in poor condition.

pain is not the unit of effort
