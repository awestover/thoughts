> Q: Is everything that happens in the universe deterministic?

I'm not even going to answer this, because I don't think the answer really matters. 

A common phenomenon:
- Some thoughts happen in my head. 
- Based on those thoughts I decide on something.
- And then I do something.
- And then some other stuff happens. 

It seems productive to call this me *causing* something, *choosing* something. 

In the counterfactual scenario where I chose not to do something, then the universe will look different. 

Ultimately, for whatever mysterious reason I have [[consciousness]], and have [[the objective|desires]]: preferences over states of the universe. I have [[responsibility]].
And, so I shall define this to mean that determinism is `False`. 

I think the confusion about determinism is actually resolvable via [[taboo]]ing the word. 
If the question is "does the universe transition according to the laws of physics" then my answer is yes, kind of tautologically: the laws of physics are defined to be the laws that govern the state transitions of the universe :).
On the other hand, if the question is "am I a [[consciousness|conscious]] agent with [[the objective|desires]]" then the answer is of course yes. 
Dang [[taboo]] is amazing!
