This feels like a definition question.

Like, I don't think "is morality absolute" is a question you could resolve via the scientific method. 

I don't believe there is any experimental result that would convince me "oh, morality is / is not absolute."

Subscribing to any form of subjective morality must be classified as [[motivated thinking]], which is not sufficient to prove that it is wrong, but is sufficient reason to mandate skepticism with respect to this conclusion.


#todo maybe I'm wrong here, and maybe I should play [[taboo]] to figure out what I actually mean here
