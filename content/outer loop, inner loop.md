I read about this terminology in a writing by Andrej Karpathy.

The inner loop is solving problems. 
The outer loop is finding which problems to solve. 

Outer loop is pretty important. Inner loop and outer loop synergy will start to happen. 
At the start it's useful to talk to people that already know about some important problems. 
But ultimately staying up to date on the field is important.
