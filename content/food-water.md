> Q: When is it good to eat "junk food"?
> A: [[taboo]] on junk

- if you made it yourself / if it's an excuse for a social gathering
- if you're thoughtfully implementing a strategy that sacrifices physical health for  a moment of pleasure, or energy.
- but actually generally energy from junk food is not sustainable / a good idea. so the above strategy is not super applicable.

but the tldr is, "less often than you think"
