Contact is one of my favorite games. 

First, let me define the game. 

**Def** (20-questions):
A game where LEADER thinks of a secret word and GUESSERS ask binary questions to try to guess the secret.

**Def** the "heavy-intersection" game. 
LEADER thinks of a secret word and gives a bunch of clues. 
Then, OPPONENT has a chance to guess the secret word. 
If OPPONENT says anything that pattern matches the LEADERs clues, then that's called a block regardless of if it's actually what the LEADER was thinking of. 
Finally, if OPPONENT is wrong then **guessers** get to elect someone to guess the secret word.

The game is called heavy-intersection because the idea is that if you have people X,Y,Z with LEADER=X, OPPONENT=Y, guessers = {Z}, then X wants to think of a secret word where Z has some comparative advantage over Y of having the word in cache. but for maximum fun levels, Y should still have the secret on disk, just not in L1 cache.

**Def** (Contact) 
meta-LEADER thinks of a secret name. Tells GUESSERS the first letter of the name. 
Then, people self elect as mini-LEADER, and lead a mini-game of heavy-intersection with meta-LEADER as OPPONENT. If the GUSSERS win the heavy-intersection game then they get a question in the meta 20-questions game against meta-LEADER.

Remark: this game is actually called Boticcelli. But I've rebranded it. sorry about that. 

### why do I like this game

At it's best, I think this game is 
- a chance for creative clues
- a chance to get to know people better
- a chance for recurring jokes
