I'm confident that I want to pursue a life of research. 
But what field do I want to do research in? There are a couple of somewhat closely related, but also fairly different, fields that I'm interested in exploring in 2024-2025 before choosing one and running with it. Of course there is the possibility of changing later, but after a point the EV of choosing one field randomly to dive into becomes higher than the EV of being on the fence.

## pure tcs
I think fundamental tcs research does a pretty good job of points 2&3 of [[point of research]] (finding fundamental truths and being intellectually engaging), but in general the pure stuff has less immediate applications. 

**What specifically would I do here?**
Some ideas: 
 - data structures 
 - distributed algorithms 
 **Plan** 
- I already have a pretty good picture of what this option looks like, and I basically have the qualifications.
- Would be good to do a UROP on distributed algorithms.
- I would need to decide who I'd want to work with as a grad student. 
## alignment
**What specifically would I do here?**
I'm not sure yet. Plan is thus a plan for how to figure out.
**Plan**
Figure out answers to the following questions:
- What papers/resources to read?
	- Arena
	- ELK
- What area would I want to work on? 
	- ARC stuff seems the most interesting. 
	- I think something theoretical is where I'd have the best chance of being helpful.
- How to prove (or disprove) that I have potential?
	- try a mech interp problem
- Where to apply for jobs?

## healthcare
**What specifically would I do here?**
- Well, the great thing about not being in the field yet is that I have no attachments. 
- So, all other things equal I'll ask around / research to see what path here seems the most helpful for increasing health / QoL. (i.e., optimizing point 1 of [[point of research]])
**Plan**
- do a urop
- could also be worthwhile looking for summer opportunities in this vein.
