I'm confident that I want to pursue a life of research. 
But what field do I want to do research in? There are a couple of somewhat closely related, but also fairly different, fields that I'm interested in exploring in 2024-2025 before choosing one and running with it. Of course there is the possibility of changing later, but after a point the EV of choosing one field randomly to dive into becomes higher than the EV of being on the fence.

## pure tcs
I think fundamental tcs research does a pretty good job of points 2&3 of [[point of research]] (finding fundamental truths and being intellectually engaging), but in general the pure stuff has less immediate applications. 

**What specifically would I do here?**
Some ideas: 
 - data structures 
 - distributed algorithms 
 **Plan** 
- I already have a pretty good picture of what this option looks like, and I basically have the qualifications.
- Do a UROP on distributed algorithms or data structures.
- I would need to decide who I'd want to work with as a grad student. 
## alignment
**What specifically would I do here?**
I'm not sure yet. I think it is somewhat infeasible for me to completely in vacuum come up with my own research agenda here. Instead I think the optimal approach is to learn some things, read some things, and then try to get some mentors who can propose some interesting projects for me to work on. Although, working on open problems from published papers is a reasonable thing to do as well. 
**Plan**
- Read more about current approaches. I'm most excited by ELK [ELK1](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vwt3wKXWaCvqZyF74/mechanistic-anomaly-detection-and-elk) [ELK2](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zjMKpSB2Xccn9qi5t/elk-prize-results) [ELK3](https://ai-alignment.com/mechanistic-anomaly-detection-and-elk-fb84f4c6d0dc) [ELK4](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FwYMuD2sNcaEpE5on/finding-gliders-in-the-game-of-life)
- Learn stuff. I'll take DL + RL at MIT. [Arena 2](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/%5B2.1%5D_Intro_to_RL) [Arena 1](https://arena3-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/[1.1]_Transformer_from_Scratch) [Arena 0](https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/) also is a pretty good resource for getting some exposure. 
- Do ML UROP. 
- Would be good to get a summer job vaguely related to this. 
	- MSR/google would be awesome. 
	- Worth checking out places like redwood / CHAI / MATS / anthropic
	
## ~~healthcare /  AI for non-alignment-related impact~~
**What specifically would I do here?**
- Well, the great thing about not being in the field yet is that I have no attachments. 
- So, all other things equal I'll ask around / research to see what path here seems the most helpful for increasing health / QoL. (i.e., optimizing point 1 of [[point of research]])
**Plan**
- Do a urop
- Could also be worthwhile looking for summer opportunities in this vein.
