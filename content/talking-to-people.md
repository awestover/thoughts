# HOW
### general principles
- Sometimes it's good to [[listening|listen]]; sometimes it's good to talk. You need to kind of gauge this by the person. Of course in an optimal situation usually you will arrive at some equilibrium of having a single conversation where all parties are engaged. 
- But sometimes more unbalanced modes of communication are ok / can be reasonable starting points. For instance, when talking to someone "shy / not-talkative (yet)" it can be pretty reasonable to give a long enthusiastic rant about something.

### specific techniques
- see also: [[questions to connect]]
- [[listening]]
- With multiple people, can be fun to say "find property in each region of the ven-diagram generated by the set of people present"; Note that this question requires exponential time in the number of people present. But, probably lots of things do, so it's best to limit your interactions to groups of about 4 people so that you can solve problems that require exponential time. Unless of course you are trying to do distributed computing in which case, you might want a lot of people. 

# WHY
- Forming connections with sentient lifeforms has some intrinsic value.
- learn cool things
- share ideas / get excited about ideas

Like I personally find that one of the parts of research that I enjoy the most is sharing the ideas.

Actually this gets into interesting philisophical questions, such as
- [[point of research|Would research be valuable if you couldn't share it with anyone?]]
