Not all last minute changes of plan are flakiness.
It's best to not commit the fundamental attribution error. 
It's also best to avoid flaking yourself. 

If you get flaked on a lot it's probably best to do these things in this order:
1. just be chill about it 
2. communicate
3. find less flaky people
