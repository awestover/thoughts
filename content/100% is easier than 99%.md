It's substantially easier to do something 100% of the time than 99% of the time.
For instance, suppose you are trying to develop habit X. 

Which is easier: 
1.  Every day, you think about whether or not you're too tired or busy to do X and then try to threshold this so that you do X on 99% of days.
2. You just do X by default and don't waste [[human compute is scarce|compute]] thinking about whether to do X.

Clearly 2 is easier.
