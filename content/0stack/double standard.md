#todo

- sometimes we have different expectations for ourselves vs other ppl
- e.g., maybe we'd feel really bad about asking a friend for help, but would feel really happy when a friend asks us for help (double standard here is "I shouldn't need help, but it's ok if other people need help")

I think there are 4 ways we error here:
- {harsh to self, lenient to self} X {harsh to others, lenient to others}

more thoughts on this later.
