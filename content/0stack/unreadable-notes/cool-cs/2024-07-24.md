$\newcommand{\eps}{\varepsilon}$

Dinur and Steuner's direct product test analysis is very cool. 

If
$$
\Pr_{u\in \{ 0,1 \}^A, v,v'\in \{ 0,1 \}^B}[f(uv)_A=f(uv')_A] > 1-\epsilon.
$$
then $f$ is $\epsilon$-close to a DP.

Analysis: 

- Define $win(a,b)$. 
- Show it satisfies some monotonicity property; it's pretty clear that it does
- Use that to show that there exists some nice $a,b$ with $win(a,b) \approx win(a+1,b) \approx win(a,b+1)$ up to $1-\eps/d$
- Then you can show that conditional on something, a random coordinate is very likely to behave well. 
- Then you can union bound and remove the conditioning and get rid of some other thing
- Then you do some more stitching.
