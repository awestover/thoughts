**Gauss's Law** 
Note that this is not actually a law, it's just a corollary of Coulomb's Law.
Electric flux through a closed surface is equal to enclosed charge over $\varepsilon_{0}$.
$$
\Phi_E = \iint_A (\vec{E} \cdot \hat{n}) dA = Q/\varepsilon_{0} = 4 \pi k Q.
$$

- Electric field lines tell you where a positive test charge would go
- Dipole moment points from negative charge to positive charge
	- this makes sense, because the general principle is that we give priority to positive dudes and let negative dudes flip signs.
