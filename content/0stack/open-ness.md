> Q: How should I be *open* to new ideas, but simultaneously have strong convictions?

Background: 
- I think having strongly held convictions is important
- But it's also important to be able to integrate new perspectives into the way I think about life. Because there are lots of ways in which I could be wrong.
	- So this generally feels like good hygiene if I truly [[quest for truth|seek the truth]].
- Also this is a way of respecting other people, which is helpful in having good social connections.

I think the short answer to this is something like
- Try to see things from the other person's perspective.
