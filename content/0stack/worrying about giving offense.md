tldr
- it's generally best to communicate clearly and truthfully.

I think this is kind of the wrong question. 
Generally your actual perception of someone is the more robust thing, and often people will be able to learn / infer this p well. 

But this is not an argument for being abrasive. 
It's just trying to get the causal diagram correct. 

The diagram is generally, 
care about ppl ---> act nicely towards ppl. 

on the other hand, acting nicely towards ppl can help fuel caring about ppl. 
acting nice here could look like e.g., learning someones name, saying hi, asking after something they care about, etc. 

Anyways, this is kind of related to TAP1. 
The relationship is, often good to prioritize being nic over "efficiency".
