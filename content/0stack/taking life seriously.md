One of the most tragic things is missed opportunities. 
What I'm thinking about rn is primarily missed opportunities to connect with other people.

> Q: Why do we miss this sort of opportunities?

- maybe we feel awkward / embarrassed or something
- maybe we have some fear of rejection
- maybe we are just playing on default mode, and default mode is to not deeply connect with people
- maybe its easier to be cynical
- maybe logistics are difficult

What specifically are opportunities that I want to avoid missing out on?
- Enjoying my classes and classmates / peers
	- it's super easy to be negative about classes. this is the default mode that we are taught in grades K-12, I guess it's an American society thing that we're taught not to enjoy classes? maybe we think it's cool to be too good for a class?
	- idk but I think this is a good one to keep in mind
	- I'm taking some really weird classes this semester, like physics, ethics, ML, algorithms
	- but they all can be cool, even if I already am familiar with some of the content
	- and yeah it's just generally good to error on the side of being extroverted even if your not naturally extrovert
- going on fun outings like randomly walking around Boston

Anyways, what to do about it?

**choices are bad**, so whatever you do it'd better be automatic. 

well, the obvious thing is to have a TAP for talking to people and scheduling things. 

ok, let's define two TAPs. gosh I love how this blog is a free accountability mechanism. Just writing something here makes me feel pressured to do it. Thanks reader!

TAP1: (sit down at big table --> "hello I'm Alek, what are you excited about today?")
It'd be a bonus if you also talked to ppl other times but let's not get greedy.
at some point I just wanna make a page with a whole table of a bunch of TAPs. 
but empirically I have a pretty bad track record with this. 
so anyways, let's see if I can remember TAP1 for a week. 
I'll put reminder to check.

- alkjash suggestion: meta-TAP `/root`
- unfortunately I only have the RAM to install one TAP rn but I'll get to this one later

I think another aspect of not taking life seriously is having predictable bugs. 
If you have a predictable bug FIX IT FIX IT PLEASE.
If your strategy of fixing it has not been  working in the past you need a new strategy ([[akrasia]] = there is no *try harder* button).
