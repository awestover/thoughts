Tomorrow is my birthday. 
Some people have asked, "what would you like for your birthday?".
Well, what I want it *truth*. Answers to the following important questions. 

1. What should my values be?
2. What career should I pursue?
3. How should I pursue interpersonal relationships?
4. How much should I prioritize things that bring the most utility to the largest number of people?

I think the *shoulds* in Q2-Q4 should be interpreted as: "which choice here does a pretty good job of maximizing expected fulfillment of values".
Then, the challenge is (a) solving Q1, and (b) getting accurate measurements about how well different actions taken in Q2-Q4  fulfill said values.
