This is mostly just a way of keeping track of progress here. 

# chapter 0: fundamentals

# chapter 1: transformers
**#1 Transformer from scratch**

The main idea is "residual streams can carry information around".

# chapter 2: RL
**#1 Intro to RL.**
It was basically just the first couple chapters of [[intro-to-rl]]. Talked about bandits, tabular RL, and DP / monte carlo /exact techniques for solving MDPs. 

**#2 qlearning + DQN**
