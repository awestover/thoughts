Let's condense the content of [[the objective]] to the following two principles: 
1. Do good work on cool important problems
2. Interact meaningfully with other sentient lifeforms
3. Be healthy (ok this is technically [[Goodhart's law|auxiliary]], but is worth listing anyways)

Ok, so we know $\nabla J_A(\theta)$, but how do we do $\theta \gets \theta + \gamma \cdot \nabla J_A(\theta)$?
Well I guess [momentum](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Momentum) is supposed to be helpful. How do you build momentum? 
Well, it could be useful to keep track of things that worked in the past, and then keep doing those. Hence this list. 

---

- 0711: read a lot of permutation avoidance literature; made a fun "relative error supported on subcube" tester. 
- 0712: read a bunch more about permutations. tried to do better permutations. 
- 0713: a good game of bottichelli with fun "abstract" clues
- 0714: Made banana bread. Had some vaguely promising ideas for analyzing cancelling scheduler. 
- 0715: Maybe got an analysis of 1.5-cancel? at least drew some good pictures and had some interesting ideas. Great property testing meeting. Tons of promising directions for future work.
- 0716: I worked really hard on diamond test large epsilon case. it didn't work out, but was still good effort. 
- 0717: typed up a bunch of stuff for property testing project. was really good to solidify what we know. also permutation party!
- 0718: null (forgot to record)
- 0719: nice proof of affinity square in cube.
