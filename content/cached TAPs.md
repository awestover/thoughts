[Trigger-action plans](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/W5HcGywyPoDDdJtbz/trigger-action-planning) are a very cool technique for actually changing your behavior.
In some sense these are an extreme form of [[acting NOW]] -- once installed, they are an automatic pattern of behavior. This post is an attempt to help me install some TAPs.
I'll write down the TAPs that I've installed / am installing and reflect a bit on successes and failures of the system.

| tag  | trigger           | action      | hope                   |

| TAP1 | Phone alarm 10:15 | Take shower | Goes to bed afterwards |
|      |                   |             |                        |
