[Trigger-action plans](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/W5HcGywyPoDDdJtbz/trigger-action-planning) are a very cool technique for actually changing your behavior.
In some sense these are an extreme form of [[acting NOW]] -- once installed, they are an automatic pattern of behavior. This post is an attempt to help me install some TAPs.
I'll write down the TAPs that I've installed / am installing and reflect a bit on successes and failures of the system.

| tag  | trigger                             | action        |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | ------------- |
| TAP1 | sit down at table with other people | start talking |
|      |                                     |               |

TAP1 did not work very well. I think it was too ambitious and maybe didn't work well in every situation, so I didn't consistently apply it, and so every time I'd have to think about whether to apply it (assuming I even remembered).
#todo: come up with a better version of TAP1.
