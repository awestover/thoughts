> A: 

It is, in the vast majority of cases, bad to lie. 
- If you're, e.g., Oskar Schindler, then this is an exception. 
- If the info is an info-hazard, then this is also an exception. (e.g., if you figured out how to make super powerful nukes / or more terrifying yet, AGI) then you shouldn't tell anyone. In fact, it would be ethical to intentionally lead people to form incorrect beliefs about whether you had such knowledge.

But *generally* lying/misdirection is bad. Basically because it causes ppl to trust you less, and probably lowers your ability to make connections with ppl. 
This can save you some compute in performing EV computations, which is useful bc [[human compute is scarce]].
